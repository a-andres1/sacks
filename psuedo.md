# building a scraper

For this project I'll need to build a web scraper to populate my page. I have a feeling this will take me a bit to get it to work. Currently, I'm planning on using python to create the scraper.

### what should the site feature?

I would like for the site to feature [videos like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYQs6jGI5MM) and stats from [pages like this](http://www.espn.com/nfl/weekly/leaders). But I really need a full breakdown of quarterback stats from each week. [This website](https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/player/_/table/passing/sort/passingYards/dir/desc) will probably also be useful.
